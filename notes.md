# Concept

Convert .vtt file to human-readable (and copy-pastable!) transcript.

.vtt looks like this:

```
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Danyel Fisher)
I wanted to start with first is just a little bit of background so we know who we're talking

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Danyel Fisher)
to. Um what is your uh

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Danyel Fisher)
background?
-
 
(Dana Bettinger)
Safaria wise or lifewise

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Danyel Fisher)
Um let's go with uh Jewish wise do you
-
 
(Dana Bettinger)
or Jewish
```

which has the data, but what I want is more:

```
Danyel Fisher (00:00:08.000)

Dana Bettinger (00:090:16.000)

Danyel Fisher (00:00:20.000)

 ```
